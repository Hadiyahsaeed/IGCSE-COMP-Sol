The AND gate is one of the three basic gates in the boolean logic. It takes 2 inputs. You simply multiply both the values.
The equations look some thing like this:
X = A AND B (Logic notation)
X = A . B   (Boolean Algebra)
The dot represents the multiplication sign. The truth table will look as follows:
A | B | X
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1
