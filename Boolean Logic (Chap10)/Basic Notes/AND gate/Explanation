The AND gate is one of the three basic gates in the boolean logic. It takes 2 inputs. You simply multiply both the values.
The equations look some thing like this:
X = A AND B (Logic notation)
X = A . B   (Boolean Algebra)
The dot represents the multiplication sign. The truth table will look as follows:
A | B | X
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

The OR gate is also on of the basic gates. It take 2 inputs. If even of of the inputs is 1, the output is 1. So you are basically adding both the inputs.
The equations look something like this:
X = A OR B
X = A + B
The truth table looks as follows:
A | B | X
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 1

The NOT gate is thes implest of all gates. It takes one input. It works by inverting(reversing) the inputs.
Equations:
X = NOT A
    _
X = A
The bar above A represents inversing. The truth table:
A | B 
0 | 1
1 | 0

The NAND (NOT and AND) gate is just a combo of the gates. You simply apply the AND gate on the inputs and then inverse it.
Equations:
X = A NAND B
     _____
X =  A . B
The truth table is as follows:
A | B | X
0 | 0 | 1
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 0

The NOR gate is the combo of the NOT and OR gate. Same as before, you apply the OR gate and then inverse the output.
Equations:
X = A NOR B
     _____
X =  A + B
Thruth table:
A | B | X
0 | 0 | 1
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 0

The XOR gate stands for Exclusive Or gate. The output is 1 if the inputs are *not* the same.
Equations:
X = A XOR B
       _     _
X = (A.B) + (A.B)
        or
           ___
X = (A+B).(A.B)
Truth table:
A | B | X
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 0
